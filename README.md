# Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Please click on the images on right side to view my solution.

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w
You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.50 hrs/ day?


# Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML (Level - Beginner)
Please click on the images on right side to view my solution.

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
Use R or Python or perform this task.
